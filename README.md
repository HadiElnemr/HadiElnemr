#### Hello there, 
I am **_Hadi Elnemr_**,

pursuing a M.Sc. degree in Information Technology (INFOTECH program) while focusing on _Control Engineering_ in the **University of Stuttgart** (October 2023 - present).

Doing my master's thesis at the [Institut für Systemtheorie und Regelungstechnik (IST)](https://www.ist.uni-stuttgart.de/) under the supervision of M.Sc. Fabian Jakob where the title is "**_Analysis of First-Order Algorithms for Time-Varying Optimisation_**".

Did my research project at the [IST](https://www.ist.uni-stuttgart.de/) which was titled "**_Implementation of a Data-Driven Model Predictive Controller for a Self-Stabilizing Bicycle_**" under the supervision of M.Sc. Yifan Xie.

<!-- Grade: **1.3** German scale GPA (1.0-5.0) -->

Took a B.Sc. degree  in **Mechatronics Engineering** from the [**German University in Cairo**](https://www.guc.edu.eg/) (GUC) (graduated on June 2023).
<!-- Grade: **0.81** German scale GPA (0.7-5.0) -->

Did my bachelor thesis at [**Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen**](https://www.rwth-aachen.de) (RWTH Aachen) (March - September 2022).

My bachelor thesis topic was "**Lane-level Map Matching Algorithm for Model-scale Vehicles**" and was done under the supervision of [MSc. Simon Schäfer](https://www.embedded.rwth-aachen.de/cms/embedded/Der-Lehrstuhl/Mitarbeiteruebersicht/~bfleef/Simon-Schaefer/lidx/1/) and [Dr.-Ing. Bassam Alrifaee](https://www.unibw.de/cas/team/univ-prof-dr-ing-bassam-alrifaee) at the [Cyber-Physical Mobility Group](https://cpm.embedded.rwth-aachen.de/).
<!-- Grade: **1.0** according to the German grading scale (1.0 - 5.0) -->
